# Superheroes-Vs-Villains
A 2015 final project for high school grade 12 computer science class. Created by Stephanie Giang, Sherry Hua, and Zoe Zou.

Superheroes VS Villians is our unique take on the classic Dots and Boxes game. Allows users' to play in a 2 player game or compete against a simple computer player. 

Work is being done on commenting and polishing the computer player.
